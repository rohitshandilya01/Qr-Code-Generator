📄 Project Description: QR Code Generator

The QR Code Generator is a simple yet powerful web application built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, created with core web development knowledge — no frameworks, no libraries — just clean, handcrafted code.

✨ Developed with 💖 by Rohit Shah, this project was built from scratch to demonstrate how modern web apps can be built with minimal tools, while still being fully responsive, functional, and beautiful on all devices.

🔧 How It Works:

Users can enter any text, URL, or data into the input field. When the "Generate" button is clicked, JavaScript fetches a QR code image from a public QR code API and displays it instantly on the page. The generated QR code is scannable and can be used for sharing links, contacts, or any data conveniently.

📱 Features:

✅ Responsive design – works seamlessly on mobiles, tablets, and desktops

✅ No external frameworks – pure HTML, CSS & JS

✅ Live QR code generation using a free online API

✅ Clean UI with an intuitive user experience

✅ Fast and lightweight
